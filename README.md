1. Enter "1. Dataset Generation" folder and run "generatorPrimeDataset.m" script to generate the file named "prime\_counting\_dataset\_gpu.csv." Copy this file to another folder named "2. NonlinearLsqFitting."
2. Go to "2. NonlinearLsqFitting" and run "fittingAlgo.m" script to generate the "fitted\_parameters.mat" file. Copy this file to another folder named "3. RSA Key Generation."
3. Go to "3. RSA Key Generation" and run the "main.m" script. Enter any number greater than 1 (1024, 2048 and 4096 are recommended).
4. The script will then show all the outputs in the command line.



**Warning:** All these codes are tested and run on MATLAB 2024b version. Use this version for the best experience.
